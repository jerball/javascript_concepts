# Javascript Concepts
## Documenting how I'd like to explain difficult JavaScript concepts

This series of documents is my biased take on how to explain some concepts in JavaScript â€” either that I have struggled with over the years, or that I find other that developers I mentor consistently struggle with.

There isn't anything new, or revolutionary here. It's more an excercise in refining my take on JS pedagogy.

### A note on console.log

I'm going to use it in my examples. Deal with it.
